# Apple App Store Payment Strategy for Nutra-Vive

## 🎯 **Payment Method Strategy**

### **Use Stripe For (30% Apple Fee AVOIDED):**
- ✅ Physical products (juices, teas, supplements)
- ✅ Shipping and handling
- ✅ One-time physical product purchases
- ✅ Physical product bundles

### **Use Apple IAP For (Required by Apple):**
- 🍎 Premium app features (if any)
- 🍎 Digital content subscriptions
- 🍎 App-only features

### **Membership Subscriptions (Choose One Strategy):**

#### **Strategy A: Web-Only Subscriptions (Recommended)**
- Users subscribe to memberships via your **website** (not mobile app)
- Mobile app shows membership status and benefits
- No subscription management in mobile app
- ✅ **Avoids Apple's 30% fee completely**
- ✅ **Keeps your existing Stripe infrastructure**

#### **Strategy B: Dual Payment System**
- Offer memberships through both Apple IAP and your website
- Different pricing to account for Apple's fee
- More complex but gives users choice

#### **Strategy C: Apple IAP Only**
- Use Apple's subscription system for memberships
- Apple takes 30% (15% after year 1)
- Simpler implementation but higher costs

## 🔧 **Implementation Guide**

### **Mobile App Payment Flow:**

```typescript
// Payment routing logic
const determinePaymentMethod = (items) => {
  const hasPhysicalProducts = items.some(item => item.type === 'physical');
  const hasMembership = items.some(item => item.type === 'membership');
  const hasDigitalContent = items.some(item => item.type === 'digital');
  
  if (hasPhysicalProducts && !hasMembership && !hasDigitalContent) {
    return 'stripe'; // Physical products only - use Stripe
  }
  
  if (hasMembership && !hasPhysicalProducts) {
    return 'redirect_to_web'; // Membership only - redirect to web
  }
  
  if (hasDigitalContent) {
    return 'apple_iap'; // Digital content - must use Apple IAP
  }
  
  // Mixed cart - handle separately
  return 'split_payment';
};
```

### **Stripe Integration (Physical Products):**
```typescript
// Physical products checkout
const checkoutPhysicalProducts = async (cart) => {
  const physicalItems = cart.items.filter(item => item.type === 'physical');
  
  const response = await fetch('/api/mobile/checkout/create-payment-intent', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      items: physicalItems,
      subtotal: calculateSubtotal(physicalItems),
      shipping: calculateShipping(physicalItems),
      // ... other physical product data
    })
  });
  
  // Use Stripe React Native SDK for payment
  const { confirmPayment } = useStripe();
  // ... standard Stripe flow
};
```

### **Web Redirect for Memberships:**
```typescript
// Membership subscription redirect
const subscribeMembership = (membershipTier) => {
  const webUrl = `https://your-website.com/membership/subscribe?tier=${membershipTier}&return_app=true`;
  
  // Open web browser for subscription
  Linking.openURL(webUrl);
  
  // Listen for app return to refresh membership status
  const handleAppStateChange = (nextAppState) => {
    if (nextAppState === 'active') {
      refreshMembershipStatus();
    }
  };
};
```

## 📋 **App Store Review Considerations**

### **What to Include in App Store Description:**
- Clearly state that physical products are sold
- Mention that some features may require web subscription
- Be transparent about external payment processing

### **Code Review Tips:**
- Don't mention "cheaper on web" in the app
- Don't direct users to external payments for digital goods
- Make sure physical product purchases work smoothly

### **Example App Store Description:**
```
"Nutra-Vive delivers premium organic juices and herbal teas directly to your door. 

🧃 Browse and purchase our physical products
📦 Track your orders and delivery
🎯 Manage your account and preferences

Premium memberships with special benefits are available through our website. All physical product purchases are processed securely through the app."
```

## 💰 **Cost Comparison**

### **Stripe Only (Physical Products):**

- Your profit: ~97%

### **Apple IAP (Digital Subscriptions):**
- Apple fee: 30% (15% after year 1)
- Your profit: 70% (85% after year 1)

### **Web Subscriptions (Recommended):**
- Stripe fee: ~2.9% + $0.30 per transaction
- Your profit: ~97%

## 🎯 **Recommended Implementation Plan**

## 🚨 **Important Compliance Notes**

1. **Never mention pricing differences** between app and web
2. **Don't circumvent Apple IAP** for digital goods
3. **Be clear about what's physical vs digital**
4. **Follow Apple's review guidelines exactly**
5. **Test thoroughly before submission**

## 📞 **Next Steps**

1. **Confirm with Apple** - Submit your app concept for pre-review guidance
2. **Legal review** - Have legal team review payment strategy
3. **Implement carefully** - Start with physical products only
4. **Monitor compliance** - Stay updated on Apple policy changes
